# Torn

Time-travel "Looper" style puzzle proof-of-concept 2D platformer. You play as a guy and you run around trying to get from one level to the next (as is the case with most games). You have a gun and the ability to "record" your own actions and then trap an alternate version of yourself in a time loop, doomed to repeat the recorded actions over and over until you "terminate the loop" (that's what the gun's for).
