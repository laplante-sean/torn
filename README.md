# Torn

Time-travel "Looper" style puzzle proof-of-concept 2D platformer. You play as a guy and you run around trying to get from one level to the next (as is the case with most games). You have a gun and the ability to "record" your own actions and then trap an alternate version of yourself in a time loop, doomed to repeat the recorded actions over and over until you "terminate the loop" (that's what the gun's for).

# Future

​Things I'll maybe do someday if this proof-of-concept turns out to be fun

* ​More platforming
* Enemies (more uses for the gun)
* Blocks - So that you don't always need a person to stand on a button
* More ways to open doors
    * Completing more complex actions like shooting a bunch of targets
    * Solving a puzzle
    * etc.
* More puzzles/levels (obviously)
    * Specifically, I wanted one where you'd have to make the "loop" version of you shoot the "real" version of you. In that case you'd take control of the "loop" version.
* Level editor - This game seems like it could benefit from a level editor
* Bouncing tiles - Tiles that bounce bullets - Used to make more complicated puzzles when direct line of sight to "loop" you is not available.
* More than one loop? How many yous is to many yous?
* More time mechanics
    * Freezes things in place
    * Slowing things down
    * etc...
* A story?
